# 🧠 Predicting Personality: Introverts vs Extroverts (Kaggle Playground 2025)

Welcome to my submission repo for the **Tabular Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 7**! This competition challenges participants to predict whether someone is an **Introvert** or **Extrovert** based on social behavior and personality traits using a synthetically-generated tabular dataset.
